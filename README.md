# Tunisian ID and Car ID Classifier

Welcome to our image classification project for Tunisian IDs and car identification cards using EfficientNetB4.

## Overview

This project involves the classification of images into four classes:
1. Front view of Tunisian ID
2. Back view of Tunisian ID
3. Front view of car identification card
4. Back view of car identification card

We have utilized the EfficientNetB4 model for its efficiency and accuracy in image classification.


## Performance

Our EfficientNetB4 model achieves impressive accuracy and robustness in classifying Tunisian IDs and car identification cards. Explore the notebook for detailed performance metrics and visualizations.

Happy classifying! ðŸŒŸ
